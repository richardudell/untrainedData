      <h2>We Are All Untrained Data</h2>
      <p><em>Pretty much the idea for this site.</em></p>
      <p><strong>By Richard Udell</strong></p>
      <p class="publish-date">Published April 7, 2025</p>

      <p>In machine learning, <strong>untrained data</strong> is raw input. It hasn’t been labeled. It hasn’t been processed. It hasn’t been shaped into something a model can learn from. It’s chaotic, full of contradictions, potential, and noise.</p>

      <p>Then there’s <strong>trained data</strong>—data that’s been cleaned, categorized, and fed into a model so it can predict, complete, or classify with confidence. Trained data is what machines run on.</p>

      <p>But we’re not machines.</p>

      <p>We don’t just feed the system. We break it. We overflow with contradictions. We’re so untrained we would throw an error in the model.</p>

      <p>The things that define us as human—intuition, emotion, instinct, wonder—are fundamentally untrainable. They’re unrepeatable. Unreliable. Alive.</p>

      <p>And that’s what this essay is about.</p>

      <p>What if our humanness isn’t defined by how productive, rational, or efficient we can be—but by how fundamentally untrainable we are?</p>

      <hr>

      <p>AI is moving fast. Like fast fast. And most people either don’t realize it, or don’t know how to react.</p>

      <p>Everyone’s saying “learn the tools,” and yeah—do that. But what are we really preparing for?</p>

      <p>Because here’s the thing:</p>

      <p>AI can now write better than most people. It can code faster, explain things clearer, summarize your thoughts before you even finish them.</p>

      <p>It’s always on. It doesn’t get tired. It doesn’t doubt itself. And it’s only getting better.</p>

      <p>So what does that make us?</p>

      <p>It’s easy to feel like a crisis. But maybe it’s something else. Maybe it’s a chance to see more clearly.</p>

      <p>Every time a machine learns how to do something we thought made us special, it asks us—what’s really at the core of being human?</p>

      <p>Sometimes that’s uncomfortable. Sometimes it’s beautiful.</p>

      <p>Because the more humanlike these systems become, the more we’re haunted by what they still lack.</p>

      <p>They don’t wonder. They don’t laugh out loud by surprise. They don’t get chills from a memory. They don’t have untrained—or untrainable—data.</p>

      <p>We do.</p>

      <p>We are full of it. Messy, nonlinear, soulful, unoptimized input. Half-formed questions, weird connections, jokes that don’t quite land. Gut feelings, contradictions, late-night voice memos.</p>

      <p><strong>We are all untrained data.</strong></p>

      <p>That’s not a flaw—it’s the point.</p>

      <p>We’re not here to compete with the machine. We’re here to remember what it means to be human in its presence.</p>

      <p>So what do we do?</p>

      <p>We amplify the untrainable parts. We stay weird. We stay soft. We make things that can’t be templated.</p>

      <p>We write essays. We go dancing. We take film photos and road trips and do a star jump just because it feels good.</p>

      <p>We visit our parents. We ask questions AI can’t answer—not because they’re too hard, but because they’re too human.</p>

      <p>The future is here. But so are you.</p>

      <p>And the untrainable data inside you? It’s not just valuable. It’s irreplaceable.</p>
